# LBD_Lecture_Slides

>  Slide sets related to the main course topics

## Usage

This repository contains all the *slides* presented during the [**Laboratorio di Basi di Dati course**](https://people.disim.univaq.it/~dellapenna/content.php?page=students) lectures.

Such slides cover most of the course contents, but not all. *Please refer to the textbooks and didactic material section on the course website* to get all the required material and, of course, **attend the lectures**, since there is a lot of useful, updated information that cannot be conveyed with static texts.

Slides are written in Italian. **English translations**, if available, are in the "English" subfolder, but may be not completely synchornized and up-to-date with the Italian ones.

Slides are currently published in PDF format to be easily displayed, printed and annotated. I am working to generate the HTML and Markdown versions, to be more web and GitHub-friendly.

*These slides have been developed for the students of this course. 
Since knowledge should be considered everyone's heritage, my material is available to anyone who wants to study the course topics. However, **such material cannot be used, even in part, for other purposes or in other courses, without my explicit permission and without citing the source**.*
